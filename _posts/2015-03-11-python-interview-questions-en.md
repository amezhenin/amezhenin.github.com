*About one year ago I wrote about [Python interview questions](http://amezhenin.ru/python/interview-questions.html) and this post gain a lot of popularity, so I decide to trianslate it in English.*

Couple of month ago I changed my job in Moscow office to position of remote developer at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#book-just-qualified-software-engineers), but before that I went throught a serie of interviews in other Moscow companies.

For the purpose of this post I tried to pick the most callenging and interesting interview questions. 

## What are meta-classes in Python and why we need them?

I will not *copy-paste Intenets* and simply leave a few link:

* [All about the metaclasses in Python!](http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/all-about-the-metaclasses-in-python/) is the first article that coming to the rescue 
* Very good article PyPix: [Metaprogramming in Python](http://pypix.com/python/metaprogramming-python/). *Sadly, Pypix seems to be down for awhile. I'll try to resurrect it, if I can.*
* This is fresh and working link: [Understanding Python metaclasses](http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/)
* And everything has started with [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python) at StackOverflow!

*Yes, and don't mix up meta-classes in Python with [class named Meta in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#meta-options)...*
