#Chapter 53. Go Independent
    
#Глава 53. Стань независимым

In stressful times, I often look back fondly at my days in a large corporation. I was nestled in both my own office or cubicle and a thick, fluffy, layered hierarchy of management. It was a joke to us then, but in a big company a smart person could get by with hardly getting *anything* done. In most cases, if a project didn’t get done, there were enough people sharing the blame at enough layers that it was hard to figure out where things went wrong. And that’s just for failures. If things took longer than they could have, the complexity of the organization obscured the reasons to a point that nobody really had a clue how long any project should take to get done.

В тяжелые времена, я с любовью вспоминаю на славные деньки в крупной компании.


So, on a day when you don’t feel like really putting the pedal to the
metal, a big company job affords you the opportunity to sit back and,
say, browse the Web for a while. Or go home early. Or take a “sick day.”
For all I complained about big company life, it definitely had its perks.

The problem is that the safety blanket of corporate hierarchy slows you
down. If you can hide behind the shield of mediocrity that most corpo-
rate divisions wield, there’s not much incentive to excel. Even those of
us who are generally well meaning are tempted by the restful oasis of
YouTube or our favorite collection of web comics. 17

In this way, a big company makes a wonderful place to go and semi-
retire for a while if you’re burned out. But if you’re striving to be
remarkable (which you are!), a big company is a hard place to get into
the right groove in the same way that a bakery is a bad place to go to
try to work off your love handles. The solution? Go independent!
You have a set of skills. You’ve honed them. You know what you’re
worth. Becoming an independent contractor is one of the ultimate tests.
You have no bureaucracy to hide behind. You are directly accountable
to the people paying the bills. The idea that you are providing a service
becomes directly apparent in everything you do. There is no team to
share the blame when you do things wrong. It’s only you, your exper-
tise, and your ability to execute.

Becoming an independent contractor also forces you to learn how to
market yourself and at the same time tests your choices in domain
and technology to focus on. You can’t rely on customers to find you
when you go independent in the way that work will find you at a big
company. You have to go out and find the customers. And once you’ve
found them, you have to convince them that you’re worth paying.

You also have to decide how much you’re worth paying. Does what
you do cost $50 per hour? Or does it cost $250? How will you pay your
bills? How will you justify the money you think you’re worth? Are you
really even worth as much as you thought you were?

Going independent is hard. It puts all your skills as a professional to
the test. You might not be ready for it yet. The good news is you don’t
have to go all the way. Consider it a personal development project,
and put yourself in the market in your spare time. Set a goal to land a
contract at a certain rate and finish it with a happy customer. Work on it
at night or on the weekends (but please don’t work on it in your cubicle
at your day job!). You’ll learn a lot without losing your safety net. Worst
case, you’ll overwork yourself for a few weeks, fail at one project, and
be sent back to your comfortable cubicle with a new sense of appreciate
for your job. The best case is that you are wildly successful, love the
work, and set yourself on a new path toward career satisfaction and
financial reward.

Reviewer Sammy Larbi suggests another alternative to going indepen-
dent. If you currently work for a big company, consider joining a small
one. If you work for an established company, try a startup. In a small
startup, you can get the best of both worlds: a full-time job with a salary
and the challenge of being pitted directly against the unfiltered prob-
lems of your business.
