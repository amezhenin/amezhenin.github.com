<p>
This page is devoted to my personal project <b>Impossible List</b>. 
I was inspired by Joel Runyon's <a href="http://impossiblehq.com/">blog</a> 
and his <a href="http://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list">Impossible List</a>. 
I thought that is actually a grate idea, to post here all callanges and
"impossible" things, that want to beat.</p>
